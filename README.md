# Remnux Malware Analysis Project

## Objective and Description

This malware analysis project aimes to  analyze a malicious file that is a rich text format (RTF) document found on LetDefend site using a linux sandboxed environment and a tool known as Remnux. To complete the LetsDefend challenge, we must find clues and investigate the file and then answer the few qustions in the challenge so we can pass it. First we conduct a basic investigation like unziping the file, finding its hash for possible osint investigation, using the file command to see what format the data in the file is in, using the sha256sum command to know and record its hash, using the l -lh flag to see how large the file is, and using exiftool to see when its been created, modified, what might be in it, what happens if executed, or if it points to any specific domains or IPs. Further, we can make use of the tools in REmnux that help anylize RTF files and detect/extract objects that may be embedden in them while also anylizing any shellcode to point out executable instructions. The tools are rtfdump.py, scDbg, oledump.py, and rtfobj. We must find "tags" which are suspicious or risky key words that can serve as clues for investigating a malicous file. 

### Skills Learned

- Investigated using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) with platforms like VirusTotal and GCK Files Signature Table website.
- Using Linux tool REmnux for malware analysis and investigations with the many commands that allow for safe breakdown of file contents.
- Looking into the malicious doc with the rtfdump.py tool with in REmnux to find potential tags or clues that can lead us in the right direction when analyzing.
- Capability of using the rtfobj and oledump.py tools in REmnux to detect OLE objects and to further learn information on exploit tactics and methodoligies.
- Navigate the scDbg tool on REmnux that analyzes shellcode to execute instructions or exploit vulnerabilities.
- Static and Dynamic malware analysis.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
  
  

### Tools Used

- REmnux terminal commands.
- REmnux tools such as rtfdump.py, oledump.py, rtfobj, and scDbg.
- Open-Source Intelligence tools like VirusTotal website and GCK Files Signature Table website

## Steps
- Step 1: Unzip the file and gather basic information. This includes the file doc's hash, what kind of format the data in doc is in, and the size of the doc file
