# ðŸ¦  Remnux Malware Analysis Project

## Objective and Description

This malware analysis project aimes to  analyze a malicious file that is a rich text format (RTF) document found on LetDefend site using a linux sandboxed environment and a tool known as Remnux. To complete the LetsDefend challenge, we must find clues and investigate the file and then answer the few qustions in the challenge so we can pass it. First we conduct a basic investigation like unziping the file, finding its hash for possible osint investigation, using the file command to see what format the data in the file is in, using the sha256sum command to know and record its hash, using the l -lh flag to see how large the file is, and using exiftool to see when its been created, modified, what might be in it, what happens if executed, or if it points to any specific domains or IPs. Further, we can make use of the tools in REmnux that help anylize RTF files and detect/extract objects that may be embedden in them while also anylizing any shellcode to point out executable instructions. The tools are rtfdump.py, scDbg, oledump.py, and rtfobj. We must find "tags" which are suspicious or risky key words that can serve as clues for investigating a malicous file. 

### Skills Learned

- Investigated using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) with platforms like VirusTotal and GCK Files Signature Table website.
- Using Linux tool REmnux for malware analysis and investigations with the many commands that allow for safe breakdown of file contents.
- Looking into the malicious doc with the rtfdump.py tool with in REmnux to find potential tags or clues that can lead us in the right direction when analyzing.
- Capability of using the rtfobj and oledump.py tools in REmnux to detect OLE objects and to further learn information on exploit tactics and methodoligies.
- Navigate the scDbg tool on REmnux that analyzes shellcode to execute instructions or exploit vulnerabilities.
- Static and Dynamic malware analysis.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
  
  

### Tools Used

- REmnux terminal commands.
- REmnux tools such as rtfdump.py, oledump.py, rtfobj, and scDbg.
- Open-Source Intelligence tools like VirusTotal website and GCK Files Signature Table website

## Steps
- Step 1: Unzip the file and gather basic information. This includes the file doc's hash, what kind of format the doc is in, and the size of the doc file.

- Step 2: Take a look at the time stamps of when the file was created, modified, and appeared on the machine using the exiftool.

- Step 3: Now we will use the rtfdump.py tool to first, look for any risky keywords on the first command and then, to use the -s flag to drill into a specific stream of the output to look for suspicous clues. We also use the -H flag command to decode the haexadecimal format in the data so that it is more readable. In this instance, the only stream that shows any risky keywords is stream #1. We find risky words like "ROOT ENTRY" AND "EQUATION NATIVE"

- Step 4: Now we use the other tool for RTF document analysis. Its called rtfobj. This tool proves to be a little more useful than rtfdump.py because right away it reveals that there's an OLE embedded object within the doc file and it also gives us the MD5 hash along with 2 CVE's that are related to this type of exploit. After that, we extract all the objects from this output and save it to a .bin so that we can analyze it specifcally going forward. We use add the -s all command to perform this.

- Step 5: We run a file command against the object.bin and discover that it is a composite document file. Then we use the xxd command against the object.bin to display the data in hexadecimal format and take note of the first few bytes. We search for those few characters on the Gary Kessler file signature website and gain more context that the .bin file is an object linking and embedding compound file. This method is used by Microsoft to embedd objects or items in a document. Attackers love abusing this method to deliver malware.

- Step 6: Since we found out that we are dealing with an ole file, we can use the ole command and see which ole tools can be useful to use so that we can learn more information. We use oledump.py tool and it seems to function similarly as the previous rtfdump.py tool but for ole files. We find a single stream labeled "EQUATION NATIVE" and we drill into it do not find much use for it. Under it could be running shellcode that gives instructions so maybe thats the next objective.

-Step 7: Next, we use the scDbg tool on REmnux which is a shellcode analyzer. Shellcode is small piece of machine code typically used as payload that can exploit vulnerabilities or run certain instructions to do a certain task. On the scDbg GUI we search for and select our object.bin ole file we want to analyze. We then click the "create dump" option box to output whatever it found to the machin and also click the "find sc" option box to search/find any shellcode. When we click launch, the tool finds 7 entry points that have a "GetProcAddress" function. Thhis function fetches an exported funtion or variable from a dynamic linked library (DLL) and proceeds its to its tasks by writing to and embedding files.

-Step 8: We have now selected one of the GetProcAddress entries of shellcode; outputed by the scDbg tool and arrived to some readable information. We can see an executable named "aro.exe" written into the file path of "APPDATA" which should be alarming. The shellcode also intstructs to load a library called "UrlMon" and lastly, to download a malicious file via url straight to file from the internet called "jan2.exe" with a domain of seed-bc.com and put this file into the application data path called "aro.exe". This is very dangerous and reveals the attackers methods.

-Step 9: We look to find the IP address and port information the malware communicates with. We do this by searching up the domain "seed-bc.com" from the url on VirusTotal, an Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool. The url started with "http" so we know that its communicates on port 80 and we found the IP address which is 185.36.74.48. VirusTotal has flagged this malware as dangerous and malicious from multiple recurring entries. We could have initially ran the first hash on VirusTotal but running a complete intial investigation is safer and more covert so that the attacker is not alarmed by the investigation.
